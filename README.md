# UCS_Director_Open_Automation_From_Scratch

## Introduction

The inspiration for this repo was a desire to help others create UCS Director plugin modules using the Open Automation SDK.

The SDK is far from intuitive, and documentation is sketchy to say the least. Hopefully the sample code and documentation in this repo will go some way towards making the process of building useful plugins just a little easier.
